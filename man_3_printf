NAME
       _printf - formatted output conversion

SYNOPSIS
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <stdarg.h>

       int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The  _printf() function is used to print formatted output to the standard output stream (stdout).
       It takes a format string and optional arguments as input, formats them according to the format string,
       and prints the result to the standard output stream.

       The format string contains format specifications, which begin with a '%' character and are followed by
       one or more conversion specifiers. The conversion specifiers specify the type of data to be printed and
       the format in which it should be printed.

RETURN VALUE
       The _printf() function returns the number of characters printed to the standard output stream.

EXAMPLES
       The following example demonstrates the use of _printf():

           _printf("Hello, %s! You are %d years old.\n", "John", 25);

       Output:
           Hello, John! You are 25 years old.

       The following format specifiers are supported:

       %c      Prints a single character
       %s      Prints a string of characters
       %d      Prints an integer in base 10
